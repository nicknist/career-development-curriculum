# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.* 

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
Matt: I want to learn more about JavaScript. I know a good amount of HTML/CSS in general, but I want to get my feet wet in JavaScript more in this project.
Nick: I want to learn more about advanced loops and stuff in JavaScript. I also want to learn how to refactor better at CSS to make it look more clean. 
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
Matt: I think it's better when we both have a keyboard in our hand. I think it's important for both of us to learn how to code it ourselves.
Nick: At the beginning of projects, it's super important to be working together so that we can align on ideas and what we want to do. Once we're aligned, I'm good with dividing and conquering as long as we both learn it as well. 
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
Matt: In person, text, and slack. I like phone calls more than texts and emails.
Nick: For updates I'd prefer slack and text. When walking through something or like explaing code a phone call would be best. 
* How would you describe your work style?
Matt: I am able to talk things out to make sure we both understand.
Nick: I prefer to have five minutes to look over something and then talk it out once I've processed. 
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
Matt: I'm a heads down, get it done kind of a guy. 
Nick: I would like to plan ahead and scope things out. I can be flexible but I like to have relative deadlines. 
* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
Matt: I like to get things done with time ahead to be able to refactor if needed. I liked having a lot done early so I could go through and update as we went. 
Nick: I like to work through things before we learn it in class so that we can get multiple reps with the subjects and things. 
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
Matt: We will talk in person and figure out what works best (come to a consensus).
Nick: After school every day, we'll work for a bit and then do a daily circle up talks in the afternoon as well. 
* How will we overcome obstacles?
Matt: We will make sure to consult each other when we're having issues with the code or how to solve a problem.
Nick: We will have conversations and bring in other groups or upper mod students to help us solve our technical problems.
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
Matt: I like to focus with headphones and a quiet environment. 
Nick: I want to make sure we're aligned before we do anything and then divide and conquer. 
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
Matt: Mornings at Turing are hard. I would like to do work in the afternoon and we have a dog at home.
Nick: Mornings at Turing I am usually there at 8:30. I'd like to work after school and then try to be gone around 6pm. 
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
Matt: I am honest and direct. Usually in person when giving and receiving feedback. 
Nick: I like to usually send a message to preview something and then have an in person conversation. 
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
Matt: I am good at HTML, CSS, and troubleshooting.
Nick: I feel comfortable with JavaScript functions and setting up HTML skeletons. 
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
Matt: Git and GitHub
Nick: Git and GitHub and make a project board on GitHub 
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
Matt: I would say that the code works and was successful, while both parties leave on a positive note.
Nick: As long as we both learn what we need to learn and are able to work together through problems.
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
Matt: I will look at Nick's code and let him know when it's working!
Nick: I will make sure to give positive affirmations when looking through the code. Maybe once a day we look at each other's code and say a positive thing. 



### Template for DTR Memo

Group Member Names: Nick N and Matt T

What feedback did you get on Dog Party today? What was your biggest takeaway?
Matt: I got really good feedback. The biggest takeaway I had is to make sure that when I name elements I think about accessibility and screen readers.
Nick: I got good feedback on my project. The biggest takeaway was to make sure that I am able to condense my CSS and make sure that it makes sense and is clean.
	
Goals and Expectations for the Project (You don't know the details of the project yet. But as you go into any project, how do YOU define success?)
Matt: I hope to get to iteration 4 and master the content in this project.
Nick: I hope to get to iteration 3 and be able to start to discover iteration 4 functions. 

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
Matt: My strength is being a tugboat and working through problems quickly and efficiently.
Nick: My strength is being a caregiver and a giant hufflepuff that makes sure everyone is happy.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
Matt: Matt is a workhorse that likes to solve problems and will not sleep until they are solved.
Nick: Nick ensures that the well being of the group is considered so that no one gets burnt out. 

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
Afternoons!

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):
We will talk every afternoon and work together to figure out what each member needs to accomplish.


Workload Expectations (How are we going to make sure we contribute equally?):
Divide and conquer. We will check-in each day if we feel like we are doing too much or too little.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
We will work together after school and then each push our projects up before going to sleep. In the morning we will pull from the master to make sure we have the same code.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
We will have a daily standup each afternoon to talk about or project and also give/receive feedback for each other.

Project management tools we will use (GitHub Projects and Trello are popular tools):
GitHub Projects!
